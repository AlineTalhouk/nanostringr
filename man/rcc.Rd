\usage{
read_rcc(path = ".")

parse_counts(file)

parse_attributes(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{directory path for multiple RCC files}

\item{file}{RCC file name}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns "File.Name", "fov.count", "fov.counted",
  "binding.density".
}
\description{
Read directory of RCC files and merge samples into count and attribute
data.
}
\details{
RCC files for a sample are direct outputs from NanoString runs. We can
extract counts for each gene in a sample. Sample attributes include sample
ID, GeneRLF, date, cartridge ID, lane number, Fov count, Fov counted, and
binding density. Both count and attribute data are then merged across
samples.

If `path` points to a zipped RCC file with multiple samples, the zip file is
unzipped and a directory of RCC sample files are created with the same name.
Only file extensions ".RCC" or ".rcc" are allowed.
